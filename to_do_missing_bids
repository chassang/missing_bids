1- include cost in lower bound estimate
2- run tests for is_rationalizable in iid case
3- compute share of non-competitive data as m moves given iid
4- run tests for upper deviation alone as m moves -- clarify that is is equivalent to unconstrained information
5- is_rationalizable_iid -- make sure denominators are non-zero
